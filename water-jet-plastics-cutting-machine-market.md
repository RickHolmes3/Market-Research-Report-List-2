<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water-jet Plastics Cutting Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Abrasive Water-jet</li><li>Pure Water-jet</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The water-jet plastics cutting machine market can be divided into two types: abrasive water-jet and pure water-jet. </p><p>Abrasive water-jet machines use a mixture of water and abrasive particles to cut through plastics. This type of machine is highly effective for cutting thicker and harder materials. It utilizes the abrasive particles to erode the plastic and achieve precise cuts or intricate designs.</p><p>On the other hand, pure water-jet machines utilize only high-pressure water to cut through plastics. These machines are ideal for cutting softer materials or thin plastics, as they do not require the use of abrasive particles. The pure water-jet method is known for its clean cuts and is often used for intricate or detailed designs where precision is crucial.</p></p>
