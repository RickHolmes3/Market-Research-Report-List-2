<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Concrete Repair Epoxy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hardener</li><li>Activator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Concrete Repair Epoxy market is comprised of two main types: hardener and activator. Hardener is a substance that is mixed with the epoxy resin to create a strong and durable final product. It reacts with the resin and helps to solidify it, giving it structural strength. On the other hand, activator is a component that initiates and accelerates the curing process of epoxy resin, allowing it to harden and adhere effectively to the concrete surface. Together, both hardener and activator play vital roles in ensuring effective concrete repair using epoxy materials.</p></p>
