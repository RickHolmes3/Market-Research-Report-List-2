<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hard Particle Furnace Grade Carbon Black Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Granulation</li><li>Wet Granulation</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Hard Particle Furnace Grade Carbon Black Market can be classified into two types - Dry Granulation and Wet Granulation. In Dry Granulation, a dry mixture of carbon black and binder is compressed into solid pellets without the use of any liquid forming agent. On the other hand, Wet Granulation involves mixing carbon black with a liquid binder to form a wet mass, which is then granulated and dried to obtain solid particles. Both methods have their own advantages and applications in industries such as rubber manufacturing, paint production, and printing inks.</p></p>
