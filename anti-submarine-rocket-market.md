<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-submarine Rocket Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Two-stage</li><li>Three-stage</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anti-submarine rocket market can be categorized into two types: two-stage rockets and three-stage rockets. A two-stage rocket consists of two sections that are sequentially ignited during flight. The first stage propels the rocket initially, and then the second stage takes over to deliver the payload. On the other hand, a three-stage rocket has three sections, each igniting sequentially and contributing to the rocket's flight path. The three-stage design allows for greater flexibility and efficiency in reaching the target, making it advantageous in anti-submarine warfare.</p></p>
