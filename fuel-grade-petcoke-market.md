<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fuel-Grade Petcoke Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shot Coke Type</li><li>Sponge Coke Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fuel-grade petcoke is a type of solid fuel derived from petroleum refining, primarily used in power plants and industrial boilers. The market for fuel-grade petcoke can be classified into two types: shot coke and sponge coke. Shot coke, also known as fluid coke, is formed during the coking process at high temperatures. It is characterized by its small spherical shape and high sulfur content. Sponge coke, on the other hand, is produced at lower temperatures and has a more porous structure, resulting in lower sulfur content and greater reactivity when burned as fuel.</p></p>
