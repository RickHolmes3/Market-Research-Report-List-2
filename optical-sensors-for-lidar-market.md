<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Sensors For Lidar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Scanning LiDAR</li><li>Scanning LiDAR</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The optical sensors for LiDAR market can be categorized into two types: non-scanning LiDAR and scanning LiDAR. Non-scanning LiDAR systems emit laser beams in a fixed direction and measure the reflected light, providing a 3D point cloud of the surroundings. On the other hand, scanning LiDAR systems use a rotating or oscillating mechanism to emit laser beams in multiple directions, covering a larger field of view and enabling higher resolution imaging. Both types are used for various applications, offering different benefits depending on the requirements of the user.</p></p>
