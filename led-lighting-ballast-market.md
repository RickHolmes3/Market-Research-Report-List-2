<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LED Lighting Ballast Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Constant-current Drivers</li><li>Constant-voltage Drivers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The LED lighting ballast market is segmented into two types: constant-current drivers and constant-voltage drivers. Constant-current drivers regulate the current flowing through the LED lighting system, providing a steady amount of current regardless of the load. These drivers are commonly used in large-scale installations where many LEDs are connected in series. On the other hand, constant-voltage drivers maintain a constant voltage output while allowing the current to vary based on the load requirements. These drivers are ideal for low-power LED systems or when LEDs are connected in parallel.</p></p>
