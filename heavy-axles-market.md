<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heavy Axles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drive Axles</li><li>Non-Driven Axles</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The heavy axles market is divided into two main types: drive axles and non-driven axles. Drive axles are responsible for transmitting power to the wheels and are essential for driving the vehicle. Non-driven axles, on the other hand, do not transfer power but support the weight of the vehicle and assist in its movement. Both types play crucial roles in a heavy vehicle's performance, with drive axles being directly involved in propulsion and non-driven axles contributing to stability and load-bearing abilities.</p></p>
