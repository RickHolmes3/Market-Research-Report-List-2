<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Degassing Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Filter Integrated Valves</li><li>Non-Filter Integrated Valves</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The degassing valve market can be categorized into two types: filter integrated valves and non-filter integrated valves. Filter integrated valves are equipped with an additional filter mechanism that helps in preventing the entry of contaminants into the system, ensuring a higher level of purity. On the other hand, non-filter integrated valves do not have this additional filtration mechanism, making them less effective in maintaining a pure environment. Both types of valves are commonly used in industries that require degassing processes to remove unwanted gases from liquids or products.</p></p>
