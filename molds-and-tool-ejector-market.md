<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Molds and Tool Ejector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spring</li><li>Electromagnet</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The molds and tool ejector market types include springs and electromagnets. Springs are mechanical devices that absorb energy and can be compressed or extended, commonly used to push the ejector pins in a mold. Electromagnets, on the other hand, use an electric current to generate a magnetic field, which is employed to attract and release the ejector pins. Both types of ejectors serve the purpose of separating the molded product from the mold, facilitating the manufacturing process in industries such as plastic injection molding.</p></p>
