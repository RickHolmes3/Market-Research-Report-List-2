<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mullite Brick Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sintered Mullite Brick</li><li>Fused Mullite Brick</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Mullite brick is a type of refractory brick that is widely used in various industrial applications. There are two main types of Mullite brick on the market: sintered Mullite brick and fused Mullite brick. Sintered Mullite brick is made by heating a mixture of raw materials at high temperatures, resulting in a solid and durable brick. Fused Mullite brick, on the other hand, is produced by melting raw materials together and then cooling them rapidly, creating a dense and high-strength brick. Both types offer excellent thermal stability and resistance to high temperatures.</p></p>
