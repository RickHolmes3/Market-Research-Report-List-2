<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Suspension Arm Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dependent Suspension</li><li>Independent Suspension</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Suspension Arm Market consists of two main types: Dependent Suspension and Independent Suspension. Dependent Suspension refers to a system where both wheels on an axle are dependent on each other's movements. This type of suspension is commonly used in solid axles and offers increased stability but with limited wheel articulation. On the other hand, Independent Suspension allows each wheel to move independently from each other, providing better wheel articulation and improved handling and ride comfort. It is commonly found in modern vehicles, offering enhanced performance and driving experience.</p></p>
