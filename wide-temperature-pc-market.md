<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wide Temperature PC Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fanless Wide Temperature PC</li><li>Fanned Wide Temperature PC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wide temperature PCs are designed to operate in extreme temperature environments, where standard PCs may fail. Fanless wide temperature PCs are built without internal cooling fans, relying instead on passive cooling techniques like heat sinks to dissipate heat. They are ideal for dusty and noisy environments, as well as applications with zero tolerance for vibration. On the other hand, fanned wide temperature PCs have internal cooling fans to actively circulate air and cool down the system. They are suitable for applications with higher processing power requirements, such as gaming or industrial control systems.</p></p>
