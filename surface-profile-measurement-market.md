<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surface Profile Measurement Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stylus Surface Profiler</li><li>Non-contact Profiler</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Surface profile measurement is a method used to determine the topography of a surface. There are two main types of surface profile measurement market types: stylus surface profiler and non-contact profiler. </p><p>A stylus surface profiler uses a physical probe with a stylus to measure the surface. It scans the surface and records data on the height variations, providing accurate measurements.</p><p>On the other hand, a non-contact profiler uses optical or laser technology to measure the surface without physically touching it. It captures the surface topography by analyzing the reflection or scattering of light. It is non-destructive and often faster than the stylus method.</p></p>
