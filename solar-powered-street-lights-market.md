<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Powered Street Lights Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Standalone</li><li>Grid Connected</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solar powered street lights market can be divided into two main types: standalone and grid connected. Standalone street lights are self-contained units that operate independently of the electric grid. They consist of solar panels, batteries, LED lights, and controllers, allowing them to function even in remote locations. On the other hand, grid connected street lights are connected to the main electric grid and use solar panels to generate electricity, which is fed back into the grid. These lights can draw power from the grid when needed and can also supply excess energy back to the grid.</p></p>
