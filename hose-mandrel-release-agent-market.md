<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hose Mandrel Release Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent-based Mandrel Release Agent</li><li>Water-based Mandrel Release Agent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hose mandrel release agents are used in the manufacturing industry to facilitate the release of hoses from mandrels during the production process. Solvent-based mandrel release agents are made up of solvents that evaporate, leaving a thin film on the mandrel surface. On the other hand, water-based mandrel release agents use water as a carrier for the active ingredients, leaving a similar film. Both types serve the same purpose of providing a lubricating barrier between the mandrel and the hose to ensure easy and efficient release.</p></p>
