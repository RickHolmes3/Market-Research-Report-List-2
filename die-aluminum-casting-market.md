<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Die Aluminum Casting Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot-chamber Die Casting</li><li>Cold-chamber Die Casting</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Die aluminum casting is a process used to produce aluminum parts by injecting molten aluminum into a mold under high pressure. There are two types of die casting markets: hot-chamber die casting and cold-chamber die casting. In hot-chamber die casting, the injection system is immersed in the molten metal, making it suitable for alloys with low melting points. In cold-chamber die casting, the injection system is separate from the molten metal, allowing for the casting of high-melting-point alloys. Both methods are widely used in industries such as automotive, aerospace, and electronics.</p></p>
