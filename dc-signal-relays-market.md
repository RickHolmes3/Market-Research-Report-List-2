<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The DC Signal Relays Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>TH Mounting</li><li>SMT Mounting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>DC Signal Relays are electronic devices used to control the flow of DC signals in various applications. TH Mounting refers to Through-Hole mounting, where the relay is mounted by inserting leads through holes on a circuit board and soldering them. This method offers a strong mechanical connection but is time-consuming. SMT Mounting, on the other hand, stands for Surface Mount Technology. This allows the relay to be directly mounted onto the surface of the circuit board, reducing assembly time. However, it can be less mechanically robust than TH mounting.</p></p>
