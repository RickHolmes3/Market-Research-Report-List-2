<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive PVD Coating Service Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Evaporation Coating</li><li>Sputter Coating</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Automotive PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) Coating Service Market consists of two main types: evaporation coating and sputter coating. Evaporation coating involves the evaporation of a solid target material that is then deposited onto the automotive part. This process requires a high level of heat to vaporize the material. Sputter coating, on the other hand, uses a plasma process to bombard the target material and transfer its atoms or ions onto the automotive part's surface. This method is less dependent on temperature and provides a more controlled deposition.</p></p>
