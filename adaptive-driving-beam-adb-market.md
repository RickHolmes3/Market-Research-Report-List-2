<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Adaptive Driving Beam (ADB) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dynamic Type</li><li>Static Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Adaptive Driving Beam (ADB) market consists of two types: Dynamic Type and Static Type. The Dynamic Type ADB adjusts the headlights' illumination dynamically based on the surrounding conditions with the help of sensors and cameras. This enables the headlights to automatically adapt to oncoming vehicles, pedestrians, and road contours. On the other hand, the Static Type ADB provides a fixed beam pattern without any adjustments. While the Dynamic Type offers advanced features and enhanced safety, the Static Type provides a simpler and more cost-effective option for customers.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Adaptive Driving Beam (ADB) Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Commercial Vehicle</li><li>Passenger Vehicle</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Adaptive Driving Beam (ADB) technology is becoming increasingly popular in both the commercial vehicle and passenger vehicle markets. ADB is a lighting system that automatically adjusts the intensity and direction of the vehicle's headlights, enhancing visibility without blinding other drivers. This technology is particularly beneficial in commercial vehicles, such as trucks and buses, as it provides better illumination on dark roads and reduces the risk of accidents. Similarly, in passenger vehicles, ADB improves safety during nighttime driving, ensuring optimal visibility while minimizing glare for oncoming drivers.</p></p>
