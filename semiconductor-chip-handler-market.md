<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semiconductor Chip Handler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pick-and-Place Handlers</li><li>Turret Handlers</li><li>Gravity Handlers</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The semiconductor chip handler market can be classified into four types: pick-and-place handlers, turret handlers, gravity handlers, and others. Pick-and-place handlers are commonly used and facilitate the accurate placement of chips onto circuit boards. Turret handlers use a rotating turret to switch between different chip components, reducing the time required for handling. Gravity handlers rely on gravity to feed chips onto a conveyor belt for handling. The "others" category encompasses other types of handlers, such as tape-and-reel handlers, which handle chips stored in tape reels.</p></p>
